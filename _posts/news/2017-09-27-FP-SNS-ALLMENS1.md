FP-SNS-ALLMEMS1 is an STM32 ODE function pack which lets you connect your IoT node to a smartphone via BLE and use a suitable Android™ or iOS™ like the BlueMS app to view real-time environmental sensor data, motion sensor data, digital microphone levels, and Gas Gauge level.

The package also enables advanced functionality such as voice communication over BLE, sound source localization and acoustic beam forming using inputs from multiple microphones, as well sensor data fusion and accelerometer-based real-time activity recognition.

This package, together with the suggested combination of STM32 and ST devices can be used to develop specific wearable applications, or smart things applications in general.
