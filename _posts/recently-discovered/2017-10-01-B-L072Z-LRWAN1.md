The B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRa®Discovery kit is a development tool to learn and develop solutions based on LoRa®and FSK/OOK technologies. This Discovery kit features an all-in-one open module CMWX1ZZABZ-091 (by Murata). The module is powered by an STM32L072CZ and an SX1276 transceiver. The transceiver features the LoRa®long-range modem, providing ultra-long-range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity, minimizing current consumption. Since CMWX1ZZABZ-091 is an open module, user has access to all STM32L072 peripherals such as ADC, 16-bit timer, LP-UART, I2C, SPI and USB 2.0 FS (supporting BCD and LPM).

The B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface, LEDs, push-buttons, antenna, Arduino™Uno V3 connectors and USB OTG connector in Micro-B format.

The LoRaWAN™stack is certified class A and C compliant. It is available inI-CUBE-LRWAN firmware package. Several examples, as an AT-command stack, are available to help users setting up a complete LoRaWAN™node.
