LoRa® is a long range wireless area network allowing low-power sensors to report over ranges of up to a dozen kilometers.

The I-CUBE-LRWAN software expansion package consists of a set of libraries and application examples for STM32L0, STM32L1 and STM32L4 Series microcontrollers acting as end-devices.

This package supports the SX1276MB1MAS, SX1276MB1LAS and SX1272MB2DAS LoRa® radio expansion boards provided by SEMTECH.

This package includes an application running on NUCLEO-L053R8, NUCLEO-L152RE, NUCLEO-L476RG and B-L072Z-LRWAN1 Discovery kits embedding the CMWX1ZZABZ-091 LoRa® module from Murata. It also supports a USI® LoRaWAN™ technology module through the I-NUCLEO-LRWAN1 expansion board. The application reads sensor data from the X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 expansion board and sends the sensor data to the LoRa® network in class A. For further details about the components of the LoRa middleware library, refer to the “STM32 LoRa® software expansion for STM32Cube” User manual (UM2073).
